I need build this with shadcn UI library
GPT
CI Task Solver
To build the PNX-assistant system using the Shadcn UI library, you'll need to integrate this library into the existing web application structure you have. The Shadcn UI library, presumably a collection of UI components and styles, can be used to enhance the user interface of your application, ensuring consistency and a modern look across the platform. Here's how you can proceed:

1. Installing Shadcn UI Library
First, you need to add the Shadcn UI library to your project. This usually involves installing it via npm or yarn. If Shadcn is a publicly available library, the installation might look like this:

bash
Copy code
npm install shadcn-ui  # Or `yarn add shadcn-ui` if you use Yarn
2. Integrating with React Components
Once installed, you can start using Shadcn components in your React files. This involves importing the required components from the library and using them in your JSX code. For example:

jsx
Copy code
import { Button, Card } from 'shadcn-ui';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Card>
    <h1>Welcome to PNX-assistant</h1>
    <Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>
  </Card>
);
3. Replacing Existing UI Components
Go through the existing React components in your application (*.tsx files) and replace the native HTML or other UI library components with Shadcn components. For instance, if you have a button defined as <button>Click me</button>, replace it with <Button>Click me</Button> from Shadcn.

4. Customizing Styles
Shadcn UI components likely come with their own styling, but you might want to customize them to fit the look and feel of your application. Most UI libraries allow for custom styles, either through a theming system or by accepting style props.

5. Ensuring Responsiveness and Accessibility
Make sure that by integrating Shadcn, you maintain or enhance the responsiveness and accessibility of your application. Check how Shadcn handles these aspects and adjust your implementation accordingly.

6. Testing
After integrating Shadcn components, thoroughly test your application. This includes checking UI consistency, component behavior, and ensuring that no functionality is broken due to the integration.

7. Documentation
Update your project's documentation to reflect the use of the Shadcn UI library. Include instructions for other developers on how to use these components and any customizations you've made.

8. Continuous Integration
If you have CI/CD pipelines (as mentioned in your project plan), ensure that your integration with Shadcn does not break these processes. Update any build and test scripts as necessary.

Additional Considerations:
Component Mapping: Map out which Shadcn components correspond to the existing UI elements in your application for a systematic replacement.
State Management: If Shadcn components have their own way of handling state or events, ensure this aligns with your application's state management logic.
Performance: Monitor the performance of your application after integrating Shadcn. Some UI libraries can impact load times and responsiveness.
By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the Shadcn UI library into your PNX-assistant project, enhancing the user interface and ensuring a modern and consistent user experience.

Start from the beginning and replace all relevant components with shadcn UI. write the file name beginning as a comment. when one component is moved to next one step by step and write all relevant codes of the component of that repository. Use dark mode with slate.
GPT
CI Task Solver
Integrating the Shadcn UI library into your existing application and employing a dark mode theme with a slate color scheme is a detailed task. To provide a comprehensive walkthrough, I'll demonstrate how to replace components in key files step-by-step. Due to the complexity and length of this process, I'll start with an example file and outline the necessary changes. You can then apply a similar approach to other files in your project.

Let's start with a hypothetical file: DatasetCard.tsx, which is likely part of your dataset management system.

1. DatasetCard.tsx
This file probably contains a React component for displaying information about a dataset.

Original Code (Hypothetical Example)
jsx
Copy code
// Filename: DatasetCard.tsx
import React from 'react';

const DatasetCard = ({ dataset }) => (
  <div className="dataset-card">
    <h2>{dataset.name}</h2>
    <p>{dataset.description}</p>
    <button onClick={() => viewDetails(dataset.id)}>View Details</button>
  </div>
);

export default DatasetCard;
Updated Code with Shadcn UI
jsx
Copy code
// Filename: DatasetCard.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Card, Button, Typography } from 'shadcn-ui';

const DatasetCard = ({ dataset }) => (
  <Card variant="slate" darkMode>
    <Typography variant="h2">{dataset.name}</Typography>
    <Typography>{dataset.description}</Typography>
    <Button variant="slate" onClick={() => viewDetails(dataset.id)}>View Details</Button>
  </Card>
);

export default DatasetCard;
Explanation
Card Component: The original <div> tag is replaced with <Card> from Shadcn UI. The variant="slate" and darkMode props are used to apply the dark slate theme.
Typography Component: The <h2> and <p> tags are replaced with <Typography> to maintain consistency with the Shadcn UI and to leverage its styling capabilities.
Button Component: The original <button> tag is replaced with <Button> from Shadcn UI, applying the same theme as the card.
Applying Changes to Other Components
You would continue this process for other components in your application, such as DatasetFooter.tsx, AppCard.tsx, AppChart.tsx, etc. In each file, replace the native HTML tags or existing UI components with corresponding elements from the Shadcn UI library, ensuring to apply the variant="slate" and darkMode wherever applicable for consistency with the dark theme.

General Steps for Each File
Identify the existing UI elements (like buttons, cards, text) in the component file.
Import the corresponding Shadcn UI components at the top of the file.
Replace the existing elements with Shadcn components, applying the dark mode and slate theme.
Test each component after modification to ensure it functions as expected and adheres to the design requirements.
Final Notes
Consistency: Ensure that all components use the Shadcn UI library consistently for a unified look and feel.
Custom Styling: If you need custom styling on top of what Shadcn provides, you can add custom CSS classes or styles.
Performance Check: After integrating the new UI library, check the performance implications and optimize if necessary.
Documentation: Update your documentation to reflect the use of Shadcn UI components and any specific styling guidelines used in the project.
This step-by-step guide should give you a good starting point for integrating the Shadcn UI library into your PNX-assistant project. Remember to apply these steps to each relevant component file in your project, ensuring a cohesive and modern user interface.

Continuing from the DatasetCard.tsx component, let's move to another component in your application. We'll take AppChart.tsx as our next example. This component, presumably, is used for displaying charts or graphical data in your application.

2. AppChart.tsx
Assuming AppChart.tsx is a component for rendering charts or graphs. We'll replace its existing UI elements with Shadcn UI components, while also applying the dark mode with a slate theme.

Original Code (Hypothetical Example)
jsx
Copy code
// Filename: AppChart.tsx
import React from 'react';

const AppChart = ({ data }) => (
  <div className="chart-container">
    {/* Chart rendering logic */}
    <h3>Chart Title</h3>
    {/* More chart rendering */}
  </div>
);

export default AppChart;
Updated Code with Shadcn UI
jsx
Copy code
// Filename: AppChart.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Card, Typography } from 'shadcn-ui';

const AppChart = ({ data }) => (
  <Card variant="slate" darkMode className="chart-container">
    {/* Chart rendering logic */}
    <Typography variant="h3">Chart Title</Typography>
    {/* More chart rendering */}
  </Card>
);

export default AppChart;
Explanation
Card Component: The div tag used for the chart container is replaced with a Card component from Shadcn UI. The variant="slate" and darkMode props ensure the theme consistency.
Typography Component: The h3 tag for the chart title is replaced with the Typography component for consistent styling.
General Approach for Other Components
Following this approach, you would continue to update other components in your application, such as DatasetFooter.tsx, ApiKeyInfoPanel.tsx, LogList.tsx, etc. The key is to consistently replace the native or existing UI library components with Shadcn UI components, applying the dark mode and slate theme for uniformity and style consistency.

Steps for Each Component
Identify the existing UI components in the file.
Import the corresponding Shadcn UI components.
Replace existing elements with Shadcn components, ensuring to apply dark mode and slate theme settings.
Test each component for functionality and design consistency.
Additional Notes
